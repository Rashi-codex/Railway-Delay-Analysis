# Railway-Delay-Analysis
 Project Description

This project analyzes railway train delays using data analysis techniques.
The aim is to understand why trains get delayed, how often delays occur, and which routes or trains are most affected.

The analysis is done using a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb), making it easy to understand with step-by-step code, outputs, and graphs.

## Project Objectives

Study train delay patterns

Calculate delay duration

Identify frequently delayed trains

Understand route-wise delays

Present insights using graphs

## Dataset Information

The dataset includes:

Train Number / Name

Source Station

Destination Station

Scheduled Arrival & Departure Time

Actual Arrival & Departure Time

Delay Time (minutes)


## Technologies & Tools Used

Python

Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)

Pandas – data handling

NumPy – calculations

Matplotlib / Seaborn – visualization


## Methodology

Load railway dataset

Clean missing or incorrect values

Calculate delay time

Analyze delay patterns

Visualize data using charts

Draw conclusions from results


## Output & Visualizations

Train-wise delay analysis

Route-wise delay comparison

Delay distribution graphs

📌 All outputs are visible inside the notebook.

## Results & Insights

Some trains show frequent delays

Delays are higher during peak hours

Long routes experience more delay

Certain routes are more delay-prone

## Future Enhancements

Use real-time railway data

Apply machine learning for delay prediction

Create an interactive dashboard

Improve accuracy with larger datasets
